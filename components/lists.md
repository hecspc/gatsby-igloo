# Lists

### Usage 

Lists are a continuous group of text or images. They are composed of items containing primary and supplemental actions, which are represented by icons and text.[Image ListImage lists display a collection of images in an organized grid.Related Articlearrow\_downward](https://material.io/design/components/image-lists.html#image-list)[CardsCards contain content and links about a single subject.Related Articlearrow\_downward](https://material.io/design/components/cards.html#cards)

## Principles

Lists are logical, actionable, consistentREAD MORE![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1lwA_3sGN_XtuhDxAjgFZDvJ1OncKHc5J%2Flists-illos-logical.png)

### Logical

Lists should be sorted in logical ways that make content easy to scan, such as alphabetical, numerical, chronological, or by user preference.![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1qS_Y9IiApIT1UXYis8ILDanPWTtOgXZE%2Flists-illos-content.png)

### Actionable

Lists present content in a way that makes it easy to identify a specific item in a collection and act on it.![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F16Sn24nRlHcMmtT2l--5mWGuQk9wtowUa%2Flists-illos-consistency.png)

### Consistent

Lists should present icons, text, and actions in a consistent format.

#### 1. Single-line list

Single-line list items contain a maximum of one line of text.

#### 2. Two-line list

Two-line list items contain a maximum of two lines of text.

#### 3. Three-line list

Three-line list items contains a maximum of three lines of text.

### Anatomy 

Lists are optimized for reading comprehension. A list consists of a single continuous column of subdivisions called rows that contain items of content.

Content types can take different forms, depending on the needs of a list.

#### List items are comprised of three different content types:

#### 1. Supporting visuals

#### 2. Primary text

#### 3. Metadata

A list control can display information and actions for list items.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1yj1ckm1If1FCbn6fgBuEHB4LexRNi30l%2Flist-elements-2.png)

#### Lists with controls contain three content types:

#### 1. Supporting visuals

#### 2. Primary text

#### 3. List control

A list should be easily scannable, and any element of a list can be used to anchor and align list item content. Scannability is improved when elements \(such as supporting visual and primary text\) are placed in consistent locations across list items.![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1YzPDIp5DDYoUf5gSiew2UpzUleXW5nLc%2Flist-scan-three-up.png)

## Visuals, dividers, and spacing

Caution.

Placing supporting visuals in the center of the row can make it difficult to see the relationship between primary content and supporting content.[DividersA divider is a thin, lightweight rule that groups content in lists and page layouts.Related Articlearrow\_downward](https://material.io/design/components/dividers.html#dividers)

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1Cdh8TPWcGTOeCpnCj40etdI3XiCF7g_x%2Fthreeline-sample-2.png)

Do.

Place a divider between rows with lots of content, such as those with three-line lists.![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1zunD2R2PhBmmFYuHWv_P6UGqTCIWsVda%2Fthreeline-sample-caution.png)

Caution.

Distinguish rows by maintaining sufficient space between list items.![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1_mv2Hsfl3zjqN4HJXn7zvToeT7JM8qRU%2Fcontent-action.png)

The primary action takes up the majority of space.

1. Primary Action area
2. Secondary Action area

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1q3CvJyhleDsbYiKaW6uoiDy9opPdmjA-%2Fcontent-hierarchy.png)

Clear hierarchy is created by aligning the most distinguishing content on the left, with the least distinguishing on the right.

1. More distinguishing content
2. Less distinguishing content

A subheader should be left-aligned with an avatar or icon in a list.

#### 2. Subheader inset

If a floating action button is aligned with list avatars or icons, the subheader should be aligned with the text content.
