## Button Accessibility

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

[Buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html) communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

* Dialogs
* Modal windows
* Forms
* Cards
* Toolbars

## Contained Buttons

[Contained buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#contained-button) are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

You can remove the elevation with the `disableElevation` prop.

## Text Buttons

[Text buttons](https://material.io/design/components/buttons.html#text-button) are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located:

* In dialogs
* In cards

In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.
