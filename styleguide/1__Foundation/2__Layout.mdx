# Layout

Taylor Digital follows Material Design's definition of the qualities that can be expressed by understanding layout, density & resolution, responsive grid, spacing methods and component behavior.

## Understanding Layout

Layouts encourage consistency across platforms, environments, and screen sizes by using uniform elements and spacing.

## Density & Resolution

Screen pixel density and resolution vary depending on the platform.

## Responsive Layout Grid

The responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.

‌
## Spacing Methods

Spacing methods use baseline grids, keylines, padding, and incremental spacing to affect ratios, containers, and touch targets.

‌
## Component Behavior

The following guidance describes how components behave, both in the grid and between breakpoints.

## Density

Low-density space is used by default but offer high-density space when it improves the user experience.
