# Imagery

Imagery communicates and differentiates a product through visuals.

## Principles 

Imagery can both enhance the user experience and express a brand’s visual language. Images help tell a story, clarify complex messages that are difficult to express with words, and to show users how to perform an action.

#### Intentional

Imagery should be used intentionally in order to create a clear story.

## Usage 

Images should be selected for their ability to express your message and reflect your product’s style. Whether you use user-generated photography, professional photography, or different styles of illustration, they should all lend a look and feel that reflects your product. Images should be related to one another by sharing a common function, style, and intention.

### Use multiple mediums

Both illustration and photography can live within the same product.READ MORE

Both illustration and photography can live within the same product.

### Have a focal point

Have an iconic focal point in your imagery, as it impacts how it should be cropped for different sizes. A focal point can be anything embodied in anything from a single entity to an overall composition. Clearly convey concepts in a memorable way.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Do.**

Establish a clear focal point when cropping an image.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Don’t.**

Don’t crop an image in a way that doesn’t show a clear focal point.
{% endhint %}

### Size appropriately

To best display images of different sizes and types, appropriately size images for different displays and platforms. Resolution is the most important factor in how quickly imagery will load. To preserve network bandwidth, keep resolution low where possible.

Test appropriate resolution sizes for specific ratios and devices, ensuring that assets don’t appear pixelated.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Don’t.**

Avoid using small file sizes that may result in pixelation of the image.
{% endhint %}

### Be accessible

#### Alternative text

To ensure accessibility, imagery should include alternative text \(or a caption\) to be read by screen readers for users with visual impairments. Without alternative text, screen reader users just hear the word "image,” without any visual details.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Don’t.**

This image doesn’t have a caption or alt text. Screen readers will just read out “image” with no explanation of what the image is about.

### Ways to use imagery

Create an immersive story and a sense of context in your app by using visuals.

Imagery helps users choose categories, or topics of interest, to better personalize the content they experience in the app.

#### Allow users to compare similar items

Photography with a common style can help users quickly browse and make a decision.

## Thumbnails 

### Usage

Thumbnails are small images that represent information in tight spaces. They typically act as tap targets that lead to primary content, appearing within components like cards or lists.

Thumbnails are used to:

* Allude to more information
* Provide a peek at content on other screens
* Assist in navigation

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/spec-host-backup/mio-design%2Fassets%2F1BU4S3F0aBs5mAnha9tQvuip8W6Mudio_%2Fimagery-thumbnails.png)

## Informational imagery 

### Usage

Informational imagery assists users in understanding content, without being the focal point in a UI. It can take the form of icons, diagrams, and avatars that represent entities or content, either literally or conceptually. They occupy minimal space.

#### Avatars

Avatars should focus on a subject, using a simple background. They can represent a user or a brand \(with a logo or branded graphic\).
