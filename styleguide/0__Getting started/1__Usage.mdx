How do Designer's use the Design System?[](#how-do-designers-use-the-design-system)

‌

1.  First, get to know the design standards and principles documented in the Foundation section.
    
2.  Next, create wireframes and prototypes in [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/) utilizing the Merge library which includes Taylor Digital's core components, styled using the base theme. _Contact us at the email below, for access to UXPin's Merge Library._
    
3.  Finally, follow the detailed usage and behavior guidelines along with each component, in the Component Guidelines section.
    

**Not using UXPin as your design tool?** That's okay, use Taylor Digital's components as a reference for detailed specifications, interactions, states, behavior and usage guidelines, to properly create these same components in your design tool.

‌

## 

**Developer's:**[](#developers)

The Design System secondary users are Developer's.

### How do Developer's use the Design System?[](#how-do-developers-use-the-design-system)

1.  First, when implementing components, regardless of the programming language, reference the Component Guidelines section for visual examples of Taylor Digital's core components, styled using the base theme.
    
2.  Next, view each component's UXPin demo, to inspect code for size specifications, interactions and states. Use this as a reference when implementing components in your specific programming language.
    
3.  Finally, get familiar with each component's usage and behavior guidelines found in the Component Guidelines section.
