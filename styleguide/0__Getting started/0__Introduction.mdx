## Our Guiding Principles[](#our-guiding-principles)

Keep these guiding principles in mind when making decisions about our digital technologies.

**Customer Centricity**

Know the customer. Before defining a solution, understand the opportunity by collecting insights. Ensure every interaction with a customer/stakeholder creates a positive experience.

**Consistency**

Everything we build fits into a broader digital ecosystem. Understanding where pieces fit within that ecosystem, and how elements can be reused to create visual and UI familiarity, will strengthen our brands and customer confidence.

**Frictionless**

The technology should feel lightning fast and seamless, with as little hesitation as possible. This will allow users to painlessly achieve their goals within our interfaces.

**Efficiency**

Streamline and optimize workflows. Help our customers work smarter, not harder when using our products.

**Subtle**

White labeling is a key component of Taylor Digital technologies, our Design System takes a minimal approach to branding and leans towards a more monochromatic visual style that will not conflict with customer branding.

**Intuitive**

The Design System delivers experiences that should be abstracted from the users knowledge of the product or business. Ensuring the interfaces are intuitive, lowers the time on task and lessen the burden of on-boarding for users.
